    <h1>Welcome to my webpage</h1>

    <p>My name is Rachel Bock.</p>
    <p>
      I am interested in becoming a Web Developer when I grow up. I want to code
      games and activities that help build character and are not "just for
      entertainment." I also want to create learning games that help others to
      become better at the soft skills that are so vital in "surviving the rat
      race."
