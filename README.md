# personal-website

First version of personal website using skills learned via <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp.org</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/wolfadex">Wolfadex</a>.

My name is Rachel Bock. I am interested in becoming a Web Developer when I grow up. I want to code games and activities that help build character and are not just for entertainment. I also want to create learning games that help others to become better at the soft skills that are so vital in "surviving the rat race."
