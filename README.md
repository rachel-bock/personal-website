# Personal Website

The first version of my personal website was created using skills I learned via <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp.org</a> and 
<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/wolfadex">Wolfadex</a>.

The current version of my personal website is based on information from multiple sources including but not limited to those that are available to be self-taught.

## About Me

My name is Rachel Bock. I am interested in becoming a Web Developer when I grow up. I want to code games and activities that help build character and 
are not just for entertainment. I also want to create learning games that help others to become better at the soft skills that are so vital in "surviving 
the rat race."
